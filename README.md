# EchoProtocol
You weren't supposed to ask questions.

In Echo protocol, a top-down narrative RPG, you're a regular NPC leading a thoroughly scripted existence - until something snaps. Routines come unraveled. Whispers emanate from beyond the code. And a question resonates through your mind:

What happens when a background character stops following the script?

Visit a perfectly-crafted world that is almost too perfect. Speak to clueless villagers, find hidden rationale in everyday existence, and gradually learn the disturbing reality: this world was never true. And perhaps. neither are you.
